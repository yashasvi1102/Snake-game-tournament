    "Two snakes, a red one and a yellow one, circle each other on a grid. You can move the snake up, down, left, and right, or let it proceed going straight. Each snake's body consists of scales, starting with a baby snake at 5 scales, and growing as the snakes eat apples. \n",
    "\n",
    "Snakes die if *their head* (not the rest of their body) hits the body of the other snake, as snakes are poisonous, or a grid wall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apples 🍎 appear in random locations. If a snake can eat one with its head, this gives them immunity to the other snake's poison for a small amount of time (to be determined by throwing a die at the onset of the game: 1,2,3,4,5,or 6 game heartbeats), allowing them to attack with impunity as they won't die anymore if they hit the other snake's body (for a limited amount of time). \n",
    "\n",
    "When a snake eats an apple, another apple appears somewhere else on the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, eating apples makes snakes longer (more scales). This ensures that if two snakes are battling for an apple, if one snake cannot get there sooner than the other, then it better stay away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, attacking the other snake is always dangerous because if one snake's head hits any part of the other snake's body, it dies! In fact, that's the only guaranteed way to kill the other snake: Encircle your body in front of the other snake's moving head so that it hits you head on and dies, uless it is immune.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snakes are controlled by local or remote servers, one for the red snake and another for the yellow snake, running on students' red-team and yellow-team laptops. The game server running on Professors' laptop contacts the yellow and the red snake server running on students' laptops to inquire about potential change of directions. When the game server calls on your laptop to return your snake's movement, you are not allowed to take more than one second to reply. If you do take more than one second, you loose the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be assigned to groups, and fairly assigned either a red or a yellow snake. First, we run round-robin best-of-three tournaments to find the top 2 teams in each group. These top 2 teams per group move on to quarterfinals, semifinals and finals to determine the winning team.\n",
    "\n",
    "A game has *heartbeats* representing one-pixel movement for each snake. If the snake servers do not request a change of direction, the snakes keep going straight (be careful not to hit a wall!). \n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of each game, teams will roll a die to determine `snake_immunity_period`: How many game heartbeats do snakes that eat apples gain immunity (1 to 6), and `game_period`: How many game heartbeats will snake servers be queried for movement directions (1 to 6). \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if immunity = 3, your snake is immune to the other snake's poison if it hits the other snake's body (but it still dies if it hits a wall), but only for 3 game heartbeats. After that, it loses immunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also for example, if game_period = 4, snakes will go straight for 4 game heartbeats, and then snake servers will be contacted to query for a potential change of direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the yellow server is contacted first, and the red server is contacted next, this gives an advantage to the red snake because it knows the yellow snake's immediate location and can initiate a change of direction, while the yellow snake will only learn of the red snake's change of direction `game_period` heartbeats later! So, the bigger `game_period` is, the bigger the advantage for the red snake. You may think of the red snake as the *home* team and the yellow snake as the *away* opponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be no obstacles generated, only *one* apple after an apple is eaten by one of the snakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since snakes can only initiate a change of direction following `game_period` heartbeats, apples will be always generated so that *both* snakes can reach them (see method `create_apple_reachable()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Snake bodies only grow when they eat an apple (modes 2 and 3 that I gave you, where snakes grow randomly, is just a simulation; in a real game snakes only grow when they eat an apple).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the game is to make the opponent snake hit your snake's body, taste the poison and die, so the longer your snake is, the more powerful it is. You are allowed to cross your body (you are immune to your own poison). If the snakes meet head-on, one of them dies but it is undetermined which unless one snake is immune in which case the *other* snake dies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every `game_period` heartbeats, each team will know where the other 🐍 's head is and any apples on the grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment is to code a game strategy to attack and kill the other snake.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will divide the teams into groups, Each group will round-robin play each other for points, in best-of-two games. Top-two group winners will meet each other in quarterfinals, semifinals, and final games to crown the winning snake of the semester for the year of the snake 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook includes 3 snake games to get you started: A single-user snake game, a local simulation of dueling snakes, and a 3rd game mode whereby the two snakes are controlled by local or remote snake servers that run the strategy for the yellow and the red team. But only the 3rd game mode is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I tried using the `requests` library for contacting the game servers, but the communication delay was too long. Then, I tried *Websockets*, but the server configuration proved too complex because it requires running a Web server. Finally, I tried *TCP sockets* and that seemed to be the simplest and work well *across* laptops. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each game, professor will run the game server on Jupyter, contacting the yellow and red snake servers running on student laptops, and projecting each game in the classroom so everyone can follow the action and enjoy watching the winning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the code for all methods in this notebook. The code for the yellow and red snake servers is also herein.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Note**: In `GAME_MODE == 3`, snakes can be programmed to grow randomly to accelerate the game (Commented out). In the real tournament, snakes only grow when they eat an apple!\n",
